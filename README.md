The country info app is a simple JavaScript app with UI designed in Code.org App Lab.  The app utilizes two datasets, The World Bank's [Climate Change Data(Country Data) dataset](Country%20Data.csv) and Code.org's [Countries and Territories dataset](Countries%20and%20Territories.csv).  The combination of these datasets provides a plethora of information on every country in the world including countries that have dissolved after 1990.  The app will search both lists and generate ids to represent locations in each dataset.  Since the Country Data dataset is not organized into columns it adds an extra level of complexity to the application that is mitigated by the use of functions to change the format of the dataset.  Once the data has been located in the datasets the data is displayed for the user in expandible sections such as economy, agriculture, and economic impact.
